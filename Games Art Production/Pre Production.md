Understanding the preproduction pipeline, evaluating and creating documents that backup the concept and preproduction part. preproduction includes world building, iterations, block outs and concept art. Pipeline establishments, resource planning, budget workouts.
Project management tools:
- schedules 
- time management 
- breakdowns
#### **The Pipeline** 
**The power of concept art**
	-a crucial part of the pipeline where artist create a visual guide and map out of how the characters could/are going to look.
	-environment design building the world and storytelling with the environment.
**Silhouettes**
	-the first step to creating an asset, character, model. 
	-creating multiple small ones within a timeframe to get a range of ideas regarding the shape and vague design of the asset. 
**Concepts**
	- concept art is a multitude of thumbnails with various designs that are SIMILAR, minor changes which would add more depth or change a minor piece of the character/asset.
**Turnaround**
	-Front, back and sides of the environment/character to show a more in depth design. 
	-Orthographic.
**character Sheet**
	-More finalised shape and design of the character which shows all angles.
	-annotations and breakdowns for some more important parts of the environment/character.
	-closeups of different pieces.
	-colour palettes. 

#### **Style Guides**
meant to keep a team on track with how the assets should look. This can consist of a mood board, colour palette and simple concept arts.

#### **Brief concept ideas**
The concept surrounds the idea of a 'high fantasy resting place'. This can include different themes such as, a pivotal moment on the quest, solving a crime/uncovering a mystery or a resting place after a long quest. 
my ideas:
- A dungeon (tomb raider style) with a treasure in the centre and traps set around the edges, a dark tunnel showing where the adventurers would have entered.
- the entrance to a temple, high stairs going up or down? a graveyard with a headstone moved to reveal an entrance? a torii gate which is a portal?
- the underside of a bridge setup with a campfire and sleeping bags arranged around it. a river running alongside it? writing on walls from past adventures? 
- a set of statues with one shifted to be pointing in a direction or holding something important. a key? a note? a gem?
- The underside of a tree with a swing and a fire nearby, also surrounded by sleeping bags. showing a familiar place which the characters return to often?
- a small cave that is used as a resting place during a storm/harsh weather.

**Final Concept Idea**
The concept is a small turnaround which is a tall bridge set in a forest and below it a dried out river, or small stream with space around it to house tents and sleeping bags below the bridge for the resting place. Along all the brick walls of the underside of the bridge will be graffiti from past adventurers.  

#### **Thumbnails**
small initial sketch of an environment containing the form and composition of the level. These are supposed to allow teams to test ideas and establish a mood of the environment to help guide a team towards a cohesive visual decision. 
**Rapid Visual Exportation**
	-Speed over polish, small rough sketches can be produced in minutes rather than hours. 
	-Testing Variables, exploring different compositions, lighting, camera angles and atmospheric conditions without committing to the work 
	-Discovery process, The best visual direction often emerges through experimentation
**Composition and visual clarity**
	- Shape language first ~ a thumbnail scale shows the basics without leaving the player lost, the fundamental structure, shapes, balance, rhythm and flow. A successful design reads clearly from any distance, no matter the detail and navigation.
**Defining mood and atmosphere**
	-Lighting tests ~ experimentation of different times of day, golden sunrise, dusk etc.
	-Contrast Exploration ~ Play with light vs shadow, warm vs cool to establish whether the word feels oppressive/hopeful/epic.
	-Emotional tone ~ Where the 'feel' is born, the feeling it evokes within the viewer/player.
**A bridge between teams**
The can help the whole studio create something cohesive. generating and refining ideas through sketching and modelling as well as reviewing and selecting decisions to further the ideas that align with the games vision and style. They can also help to create blueprints and playable environments that match the characters and overall art style.
**The efficiency advantage**
Low investment ~ Thumbnails require minimal time and recourses 
high freedom ~ artists can experiment boldly without fear of wasting effort 
rapid iteration ~ Discard weak concepts and refine promising ones
Creative breakthrough ~ Pressure free exploration often yields the most innovative solutions. 
**From sketch to final vision**
The chosen thumbnail becomes the architectural blueprint for everything that follows - guiding all of the following concepts, informing 3D block outs and establishing the spatial logic of level design.
Thumbnail > Detailed Concept > 3D blockout > Final environment 

**The six pillars of thumbnail value**
Idea Exploration ~ Quickly test multiple visual directions without committing resources 
Composition ~ Ensure visual clarity 
Mood definition
Team Communication
Efficiency 
Foundation ~

### **Start small Think big**


**The importance of concept for 3D assets, scenes and dioramas**
A strong concept serves as a visual compass throughout the entire production journey. 
- Visual blueprint, concept visual plan
- Style & story, Defines the aesthetic direction, narrative and emotional atmosphere
- Production Guide, provides clear direction for more technical design elements 
Establishing the visual foundation is setting the standard and allowing yourself to get a look and feel for the project. A visual foundation becomes the reference point that ensures consistency. Supporting the storytelling and atmosphere, narrative through design, tone and emotion & diorama storytelling.
**ensures composition and balance**
- focal points, identify and plan the places of interest
- depth layers, define the fore, mid and background elements
- lighting direction, establish light sources and the impact 
- colour harmony, plan colour relationships and how they contrast against each other
Early problem detection 
reduce reworks 
organised efficiency 
**defines scale mood and lighting 
- scale and proportion
	- clarify object relationships and proportions to create believable intentionally surreal environments

#### **Scene design and hero props**
layout blocking- early geometry to map out space and player flow.
Mood & atmosphere - colour, aesthetic, and weather to create emotion.
***Guiding** **questions***
what will the story or gameplay need?
what is happening in the scene?
what is the player supposed to feel or do?
create a mood board (should have one already)?
references for tone and lighting?
what guides them through the space?
interesting props and scene designs?

**what is hero prop**
A visually and narratively important object within a scene, its purpose is to guide the players eye. Supports the story of gameplay and often interacted with or closely observe. This prop should not only be more visually appealing but also provide contrast around the other assets in the scene. The anchor or the environment.
Designing a hero prop takes time but also a focus on key features, a hero prop should have a:
-detailed concept art
-unique materials or effects 
-higher poly/texture or effects 
-integrated into gameplay or story 

**What's included in your concept and journal**
-show initial sketches or blockout 
-Highlight the hero Prop
-Show final render with lighting and polish
-explain how pre-production guided the process

**key Points**
-Pre-production is not optional, its essential
-scene design is storytelling through space 
-the hero prop is the anchor of your environment 
-a strong preproduction phase=a strong production
