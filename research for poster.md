lucas pope 
- creator of papers, please 
- originally coded in haxe, to allow for different platform releases easily 
- previously worked for naughty dog
- his reasoning for creating the game stems from him loosing his passport and struggling to get back to his home country, being a scared person who just wants to solve the issue but to the government youre nothing more than an anomaly, a problem to fix.
- he wanted to capture that ambiguity, 'this vagueness to everything, not knowing for sure what anybody is saying is true'
- he wanted the game to feel awkward, as his love for visuals and writing tools took over with the UI, lots of reading and reading. making the player second guess themsevles and leave more room for error.
- as a young developer, he went through 'trial by fire' being pushed into working on Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, as it was halfway through production - creating UI tools for the team and providing a unique and interesting experience.
- wokred closely with the game director, Bruce Stradley, (goes on to work on TLOU) who gave him good advice - 'how to sacrifice a lot of work that's already done in order to make a better game'
- worked on a game with his wife, also a game developer, creating the pc game Mightier 
- before papers pleased was made, he created a flash game in a warmup to Ludem Dare 23 in 2012, The Republican Times, seeing the player as a editor-in-chief for a newspaper in a country at war with Arstozka. 
- haxe is a high-level-cross-platform programming language and compiler that can produce applications and souce code for many different computing platforms from one code-base. free and open source software

early life- 
Lucas pope was born in 1978/1979 in Virginia America, and growing up, had a large access to an array of parts and tools which grew into a love for mechanical engineering. in highschool, he met a friend who helped give him an interest in robotics, and together they would take apart retail robotic kits while hooking them up to home computers to see how far they could push the cheap hardware and tweak the controls. this then inspired him to continue into the industry taking a course in mechanical engineering at Virginia tech. After finishing his degree, he learned that he was more interested in the software element of the coursework and aas a result he got involved with the Quake community developing mods, primarily working on art used for characters within these mods.
introduction to the industry- As his love for modding took off, he decided to start a games company with another set of modders which is how Ratloop was created. They created a wellknown mod called Malice for Quake. While this did well in itself, the early industry had too many drawbacks with physical game copies required as well as publishers to fund such copies, and although it was taken up by Acitivision for retail distribution anything else which Ratloop created wasnt ever published, causing the company to eventually become dormant.
