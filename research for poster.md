lucas pope 
- creator of papers, please 
- originally coded in haxe, to allow for different platform releases easily 
- previously worked for naughty dog
- his reasoning for creating the game stems from him loosing his passport and struggling to get back to his home country, being a scared person who just wants to solve the issue but to the government youre nothing more than an anomaly, a problem to fix.
- he wanted to capture that ambiguity, 'this vagueness to everything, not knowing for sure what anybody is saying is true'
- he wanted the game to feel awkward, as his love for visuals and writing tools took over with the UI, lots of reading and reading. making the player second guess themsevles and leave more room for error.
- as a young developer, he went through 'trial by fire' being pushed into working on Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, as it was halfway through production - creating UI tools for the team and providing a unique and interesting experience.
- wokred closely with the game director, Bruce Stradley, (goes on to work on TLOU) who gave him good advice - 'how to sacrifice a lot of work that's already done in order to make a better game'
- worked on a game with his wife, also a game developer, creating the pc game Mightier 
- before papers pleased was made, he created a flash game in a warmup to Ludem Dare 23 in 2012, The Republican Times, seeing the player as a editor-in-chief for a newspaper in a country at war with Arstozka. 
- haxe is a high-level-cross-platform programming language and compiler that can produce applications and souce code for many different computing platforms from one code-base. free and open source software
